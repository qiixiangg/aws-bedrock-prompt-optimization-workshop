This comprehensive weather service provides real-time data including temperature (Celsius and Fahrenheit), humidity percentage, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, visibility, UV index, and precipitation probability. Extended forecasts are available for up to 14 days with hourly granularity for the first 48 hours and daily summaries thereafter. Historical weather data is accessible for the past 30 days for comparison and trend analysis. The service covers over 200,000 cities globally and supports coordinates-based queries for precise locations. Weather alerts and warnings from national meteorological services are included when active for the requested location. Air quality index (AQI) and pollen counts are available for supported regions. Data sources include government weather services, satellite imagery, ground stations, and crowd-sourced observations for maximum accuracy. Response times are typically under 500ms with 99.9% uptime SLA.",
