# Part 3: Advanced Concepts

This section covers advanced prompt engineering techniques and complex caching patterns for production GenAI systems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Apply research-backed prompt engineering techniques (CoT, Self-Refine, CoD, etc.)
- Select the right technique for your scenario
- Implement multi-checkpoint caching patterns
- Optimize for latency, cost, and accuracy trade-offs

## Notebooks

| Notebook | Duration | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| 01-advanced-prompt-engineering| 60-90 min | Technique categories, optimization workflows |
| [02-advanced-prompt-caching](./02-advanced-prompt-caching.ipynb) | 60 min | Multi-checkpoint patterns, cache strategies |
| 03-prompt-version-control | TBD | CI/CD |
