    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to structure system prompts for clarity and consistency\n",
    "- How to use `max_tokens` to limit output length\n",
    "- How to use `stop_sequences` to end responses early\n",
    "- How to set appropriate `temperature` for accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizations in this notebook:**\n",
    "1. Well-structured prompt with sections, guidelines, and few-shot examples (~1,030 tokens vs ~1,500 unstructured)\n",
    "2. `max_tokens=1024` limit (allows detailed responses)\n",
    "3. Stop sequences `[\"###\", \"END_RESPONSE\"]`\n",

      "I understand how concerning it is when your laptop won't turn on. Let me help you troubleshoot this issue with some proven steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "**answer:** I know it's frustrating when your laptop won't power on. Let's work through these troubleshooting steps systematically:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check the power connection**\n",
      "   - Ensure the power adapter is firmly plugged into both the laptop and wall outlet\n",
      "   - Look for LED lights on the adapter - if there's no light, the adapter may be faulty\n",
      "   - Try a different wall outlet to rule out outlet issues\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Perform a hard reset**\n",
      "   - Disconnect the power adapter\n",
      "   - If possible, remove the battery (for laptops with removable batteries)\n",
      "   - Hold down the power button for 30-45 seconds\n",
      "   - Reconnect power (leave battery out if removable) and try turning it on\n",
      "   - If successful, shut down and reinstall the battery\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for signs of life**\n",
      "   - Listen for fan noise or hard drive sounds\n",
      "   - Look for any LED indicators (power, charging, caps lock)\n",
      "   - Check if the screen is just dark but the laptop is actually on\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Test with external display**\n",
      "   - Connect to an external monitor to see if it's a display issue rather than the laptop not powering on\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Inspect for physical issues**\n",
      "   - Check for any damage to the power port\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Structure matters more than brevity.** A well-organized prompt with headers, bullet points, and clear sections helps the model locate instructions efficiently. This reduces both input tokens (shorter prompt) and output tokens (more focused responses).\n",
