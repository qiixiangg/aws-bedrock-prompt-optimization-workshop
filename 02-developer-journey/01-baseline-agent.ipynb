      "   - Reconnect everything and try turning it on again\n",

      "   - Are there any lights turning on at all?\n",
      "   - Does the screen show anything, even briefly?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Try an external display:**\n",
      "   - If you have an external monitor, connect it to see if the issue is with the screen rather than the laptop itself\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Check the power adapter:**\n",
      "   - Feel if the power adapter is warm (it should be slightly warm when working)\n",
      "   - Look for any damage to the cable\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you let me know what happens when you try to turn it on? Does anything light up, make noise, or show any signs of power? This will help me guide you to the next steps. Also, is this a laptop you purchased from TechMart Electronics?\n",
