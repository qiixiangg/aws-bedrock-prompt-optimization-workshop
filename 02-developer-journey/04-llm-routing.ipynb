    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement **model routing** to use cheaper models for simple queries while preserving quality for complex ones. The key insight is that **an LLM can classify queries more accurately than keyword matching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- How to classify query complexity using an LLM\n",
    "- How to route queries to appropriate models (Haiku vs Sonnet)\n",
    "- How to verify routing decisions in Langfuse\n",
    "- Cost savings from intelligent routing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing Strategy:**\n",
    "- Simple queries → Claude Haiku (smaller, faster, cheaper)\n",
    "- Complex queries → Claude Sonnet (more capable, higher quality)\n",

    "## Step 2: Understanding Model Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Route Between Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all queries require the same level of reasoning. A simple \"What's your return policy?\" doesn't need the full power of Sonnet—Haiku can handle it at a fraction of the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claude Haiku** — ~4x cheaper than Sonnet, best for simple Q&A, lookups, and greetings. Requires 4,096 tokens minimum for prompt caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claude Sonnet** — More capable model for complex reasoning and troubleshooting. Requires 1,024 tokens minimum for prompt caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system prompt (~1,030 tokens) only meets Sonnet's caching threshold. Haiku requests won't benefit from prompt caching, but the ~4x cost savings still make it worthwhile for simple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routing Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyword matching** — Fast with no LLM cost, but brittle and misses semantic variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM-based classification** — Accurate and handles edge cases, with negligible overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding similarity** — No LLM call needed, but requires training data and more complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **LLM-based classification** with Haiku—the classification cost is negligible compared to the savings from routing simple queries away from Sonnet."

    "In this notebook, we implemented intelligent model routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLM-based classification** — Haiku classifies queries as \"simple\" or \"complex\" using a single-word response\n",
    "2. **Cost-effective routing** — Simple queries go to Haiku (~4x cheaper), complex to Sonnet\n",
    "3. **Prompt caching for Sonnet only** — Haiku requires 4,096 tokens minimum (our prompt is ~1,030), so only Sonnet requests benefit from caching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM classification beats keyword matching** — Handles semantic variations and edge cases\n",
    "- **Simple text parsing is reliable** — Few-shot examples in the prompt ensure consistent \"simple\" or \"complex\" responses\n",
    "- **Real cost savings** — Compare the v3 vs v4 metrics above to see actual savings from routing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:** In Lab 05, we'll add Bedrock Guardrails to filter off-topic queries before they reach the LLM."
