# AWS Credentials
# Option 1: Use AWS CLI credentials (recommended)
# If you have AWS CLI configured, leave these commented out
# boto3 will automatically use credentials from ~/.aws/credentials

# Uncomment and set these if you prefer to use .env file
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
