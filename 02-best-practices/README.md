# Part 2: Best Practices

## Overview

Master prompt caching and optimization through hands-on implementation with immediate practice after each concept.

**Duration**: ~5 hours

---

## Notebooks

### **01-prompt-caching.ipynb** (2.5 hours)

Learn caching patterns and strategy principles with immediate hands-on practice.

**Part A: Caching Patterns** (90 min)
- Pattern 1: Single checkpoint → Code → 🔬 Practice (30 min)
- Pattern 2: Multi-checkpoint → Code → 🔬 Practice (40 min)
- Pattern 3: Simplified caching → Code → 🔬 Practice (20 min)

**Part B: Strategy Principles** (60 min)
- Principle 1: Longest prefix → Code → 🔬 Practice (15 min)
- Principle 2: Static/dynamic separation → Code → 🔬 Practice (15 min)
- Principle 3: Monitor performance → Code → 🔬 Practice (20 min)
- Principle 4: Cache warm-up → Code → 🔬 Practice (10 min)

**7 integrated exercises** for immediate reinforcement.

### **02-prompt-optimization.ipynb** (2.5 hours)

Learn manual and automated optimization with comprehensive hands-on lab.

**Sections**:
1. Decision Framework (15 min)
2. Manual Optimization: Clear instructions, few-shot examples, Chain-of-Thought, structured output (45 min)
3. Automated Optimization: Bedrock API, Metaprompting, Data-Aware, DSPy (30 min)
4. 🔬 Optimization Lab: Apply techniques systematically (45 min)
5. Best Practices: Model selection, version control, monitoring (20 min)
